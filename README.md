# FAST_KLT

Build Instructions
To build the program, follow these steps:

1. Build OpenCV with CMake
Use CMake to build OpenCV and place the compiled files at the following path: FAST_KLT/external/opencv/build. Both static and dynamic linking options are available.

# Example with cmake-gui for Microsoft Visual Studio 2022

Browse source and build directories to "..external/opencv" for Source and "..external/opencv/build" for Build

2. Build the Project
After successfully building OpenCV, proceed to build the FAST_KLT project itself.
```
cd FAST_KLT/build
cmake ..
make
```
This will generate the executable for the FAST_KLT project. Ensure that all dependencies are correctly linked during the build process.
